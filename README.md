Design Patterns
- Strategy Pattern
    - Conventionally, the Strategy pattern is written by having an interface that is implemented by different classes.
Adding a new strategy means adding a new implementation class. With enums, we can achieve this with less effort, and adding a new implementation means simply defining another instance with some implementation
